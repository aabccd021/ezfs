# ezfs
Easy ZFS configuration for NixOS

# TODO
- sanoid built in
- create single `ezfs` command reading from json config file
- set pubkey auth true for ssh, make sure throws error if disabled by external config
- better sshd config, shouldn't need to set hostKeys ourself
- make sure no two hostKey with same type
